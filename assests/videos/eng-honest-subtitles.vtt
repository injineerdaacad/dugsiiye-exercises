Welcome to my video! Hope you enjoy watching.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
In this video, I will introduce myself and share some exciting details.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
I am Engineer Honest, a full-stack developer specializing in web and mobile app development.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
I work with a wide range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
On the frontend, I build dynamic UIs using React and React Native.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For the backend, I utilize Node.js along with MongoDB or Firebase for data storage.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I also develop mobile applications using Flutter with Dart and Firebase.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Clean and maintainable code is essential in every project I work on.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Reusable components in React make development faster and more efficient.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Using Firebase allows seamless real-time data synchronization.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Tailwind CSS speeds up the styling process with utility-first classes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Continuous learning is key to staying ahead in the fast-paced tech world.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That’s all for today’s video. I hope you found it helpful.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
