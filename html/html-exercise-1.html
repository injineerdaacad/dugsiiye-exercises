    <h1>MY HOBBY IS CODING</h1>

    <p>
      I am passionate about technology, especially programming. In my free time,
      I write code and learn new software development techniques. Coding allows
      me to express creativity and problem-solving skills, and I see every
      challenge as a chance to learn.
